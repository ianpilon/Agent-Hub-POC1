It\u2019s secured entirely on-chain via the Handle Standard. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nUnique NFTs: Each ADA Handle is a unique NFT, minted and issued on the Cardano blockchain. These NFTs act as unique identifiers for the UTXO (unspent transaction output) that they reside in.\n\nSecured on Cardano Layer 1: Unlike many other routing services on Ethereum, ADA Handles are secured entirely as native assets on the Cardano blockchain, specifically on the Layer 1 ledger. This means they don\u2019t rely on smart contracts for address routing, ensuring accuracy even in unlikely scenarios.\n\nStandard for Upgrades: The Handle Standard supports version upgrading and backward compatibility. When a new version is introduced, partners are notified of the new version\u2019s Policy ID. Lookups occur from the most recent Policy ID to the first, encouraging upgrades for faster retrieval results.\n\nFuture Roadmap: ADA Handle has an in-depth roadmap, including plans for a future DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for governance and community-voted Handle Augmentation support. Handle Augmentation will allow users to opt-in to additional metadata for their unique Handle, creating an extendable pattern for partners to build upon123.", "x": "https://x.com/adahandle", "x_reach": "  44,700.00 ", "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/@ada.handle", "youtube_reach": "  22.00 ", "discord": "https://discord.com/invite/sYkFgRQFwG", "discord_reach": "  8,694.00 ", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/ada-handle/", "www": "https://mint.handle.me/", "location": "", "geography": "Geographical Region", "email": "Direct Contact", "phone": "Direct Contact", "comment": "", "score": "2.3", "score_stable": "1", "score_open": "1", "score_strong": "", "score_aligned": "", "score_capacity": "", "score_flywheel": "0", "comment_stable": "Appears to be - Ada Handle was founded in 2021.", "comment_open": "Openly supports Cardano - ADA Handle is an NFT-powered naming solution for your Cardano wallet address.

These NFTs act as unique identifiers for the UTXO (unspent transaction output) that they reside in.\n\nSecured on Cardano Layer 1: Unlike many other routing services on Ethereum, ADA Handles are secured entirely as native assets on the Cardano blockchain, specifically on the Layer 1 ledger. This means they don\u2019t rely on smart contracts for address routing, ensuring accuracy even in unlikely scenarios.\n\nStandard for Upgrades: The Handle Standard supports version upgrading and backward compatibility. When a new version is introduced, partners are notified of the new version\u2019s Policy ID. Lookups occur from the most recent Policy ID to the first, encouraging upgrades for faster retrieval results.\n\nFuture Roadmap: ADA Handle has an in-depth roadmap, including plans for a future DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for governance and community-voted Handle Augmentation support.

When a new version is introduced, partners are notified of the new version\u2019s Policy ID. Lookups occur from the most recent Policy ID to the first, encouraging upgrades for faster retrieval results.\n\nFuture Roadmap: ADA Handle has an in-depth roadmap, including plans for a future DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for governance and community-voted Handle Augmentation support.
